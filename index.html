      <p>My name is Grace and I'm a third year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. My area of expertise is full stack development with an emphasis on front-end. I'm very interested in embedded development and hardware and hope to work with either in the future.</p>
      <p>For Fall 2017, I worked as a front-end developer for Shopify, doing development on Shopify.com. I've also interned at Imagine Communications and RBC in full stack roles.</p>
      <p>I love drawing and playing Smash(4). I do freelance art, have a look below!</p>
