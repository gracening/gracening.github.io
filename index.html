      <p>Hey, my name is Grace and I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. My current focus is full stack development with an emphasis on front-end.</p>
      <p>For Winter 2017, I worked as a full stack developer for Imagine Communications in Waterloo, ON. I was primarily working on Onyx, a cloud-based playlist automation solution for TV stations such as ABC and Disney. I worked extensively with AngularJS, TypeScript and C#.</p> 
      <p>For Spring 2016, I worked at RBC developing an ASP.NET application to manage their databases. I've added support for Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, Oracle and DB2.</p> 
      <p>Aside from programming, I've always been passionate about art, and I work as a freelance artist; have a look at some of my artwork below! I also enjoy playing piano and Smash (4).</p>
