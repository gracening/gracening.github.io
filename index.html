      <p>My name is Grace and I'm a third year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. My area of expertise is full stack development with an emphasis on front-end. I have a personal interest in design and graphics.<p>
      <p>My most recent internship was at Splunk in a back-end role working on the Machine Learning Toolkit. For Fall 2017, I worked as a front-end developer for Shopify, doing development on Shopify.com. I've also interned at Imagine Communications and RBC in full stack roles.</p>
      <p>I love drawing and playing Smash(4). I do freelance art, have a look below!</p>
